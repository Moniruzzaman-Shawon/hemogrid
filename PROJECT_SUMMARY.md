# Hemogrid - Blood Donation Management System

## Project Overview

Hemogrid is a comprehensive blood donation management system that connects blood donors with recipients in need. The platform facilitates seamless communication between donors and recipients while providing administrative oversight for the entire system.

## Implementation Status: COMPLETE

All requirements from the README.md have been successfully implemented and tested.

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (Django + DRF)
- **Framework**: Django 5.2.5 + Django REST Framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with sample data
- **Authentication**: JWT with email verification
- **File Storage**: Cloudinary integration
- **Email**: SMTP with Gmail integration
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI

### Frontend (React + Vite)
- **Framework**: React 18 + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **HTTP Client**: Axios with interceptors

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. User Management
- **Registration**: Email-based registration with verification
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- **Profile Management**: Complete donor profiles with all required fields
- **Role-based Access**: Admin, User, Donor roles with proper permissions

### 2. Blood Request System
- **Create Requests**: Comprehensive request form with all fields
- **Request Management**: Accept, Complete, Cancel functionality
- **Status Tracking**: Pending → Accepted → Completed/Cancelled
- **Visibility Control**: Users cannot see their own requests

### 3. Dashboard System
- **User Dashboard**: Recipient-centric with tabs for requests and history
- **Admin Dashboard**: System metrics, user management, request oversight
- **Donor Dashboard**: Integrated profile and availability management

### 4. Public Interface
- **Donor Listing**: Public homepage with available donors
- **Search & Filter**: Blood group filtering and name/address search
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with modern UI

### 5. Communication System
- **Email Notifications**: Automated emails for request acceptance
- **Contact Sharing**: Protected contact reveal after acceptance
- **Status Updates**: Real-time status changes with notifications

### 6. Admin Portal
- **System Metrics**: Total users, requests, fulfilled requests, active donors
- **User Management**: View, verify, and manage user accounts
- **Request Oversight**: Monitor and manage all blood requests
- **Analytics**: Most active donors and system statistics

## Acceptance Criteria Status

- Registration sends email; activation enables login
- Unverified login blocked with clear message; resend works
- Users can create requests; cannot see own request in list
- Other users can accept a request; entry appears in donor's history
- Request status transitions enforced and auditable
- Donor profile form saves: name, age, address, last donation date, availability
- Authenticated dashboard shows Recipient Requests and Donation History
- Public homepage lists available donors; sign-in gate on "request blood"
- Filter donors by blood group; optional search works
- Admin dashboard: key metrics and moderation actions available

## Technical Features

### Security
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- Email verification for account activation
- Role-based access control
- CORS configuration for production
- Input validation and sanitization

### Performance
- Database optimization with proper indexing
- Pagination for large datasets
- Static file optimization with WhiteNoise
- Image optimization with Cloudinary
- Efficient API endpoints

### User Experience
- Responsive design for all devices
- Loading states and error handling
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Intuitive navigation and workflows
- Accessibility considerations

## Deployment Ready

### Production Configuration
- **Settings**: Separate production settings with security hardening
- **Environment**: Comprehensive environment variable configuration
- **Server**: Gunicorn configuration for production deployment
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with production optimizations
- **SSL**: Ready for HTTPS deployment
- **Monitoring**: Logging and error tracking configured

### Deployment Options
- **Backend**: VPS, AWS, DigitalOcean, Railway, Render
- **Frontend**: Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3, GitHub Pages
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on cloud providers
- **File Storage**: Cloudinary (already configured)
